        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Pizza Rossini is a typical specialty of the city of <strong>Pesaro</strong>. I became aware of this pizza thanks to my friend Lucia, who as a good Pesaro resident informed me of its existence and recommended it. This pizza is named after the famous Pesaro composer <strong>Gioachino Rossini</strong>, who used to request <strong><em>pizza margherita garnished with hard-boiled egg and mayonnaise</em></strong>. This is how the city of Pesaro introduced this specialty into its culinary tradition.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>For Base</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flour - 300g </li>
                    <li>Fresh brewer's yeast - 3g</li>
                    <li>Water - 180ml</li>
                    <li>Extra-virgin olive oil - 1 tbs </li>
                    <li>Salt - 4g</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>For Filling</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tomato sauce - 200g</li>
                    <li>Eggs - 4</li>
                    <li>Mozzarella cheese - 200g</li>
                    <li>Mayonnaise - to taste </li>
                    <li>Extra virgin olive oil - to taste</li>
                    <li>Oregano - pinch</li>
                    <li>Fine salt - to taste</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pour the flour into a large bowl, add the fresh brewer's yeast - if you can't weigh one gram, take a pinch from the block and you can freeze the rest. Add the cold water gradually and start kneading. If you have the possibility and don't want to knead by hand, use a stand mixer</li>
                    <li>After reaching a good consistency, work your dough on the work surface, you'll need to knead it perfectly. Add the salt and the remaining water gradually, continue working the dough. Once ready, you'll notice bubbles, which means the dough has incorporated enough air and is well worked. Add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and let it absorb that too</li>
                    <li>Make a few quick folds, cover with a bowl like a dome, let it rest for about ten minutes and repeat the folding. Place your pizza base in a bowl greased with a drizzle of oil, cover with a lid or plastic wrap and let it rise for about 10 hours</li>
                    <li>Once your dough has risen, thus doubled in volume, turn it out onto the work surface, divide it into two parts (if you prefer you can divide it into three parts), make a few folds and roll the dough on itself rotating it on the work surface with your palms. Place the balls in two bowls greased with a drizzle of oil or in a single container keeping them spaced apart, let your pizza bases rise for about three more hours, or until doubled in volume</li>
                    <li>Cook the eggs in plenty of water for 8 minutes, once hard-boiled, peel them, wash them under running water and slice them</li>
                    <li>Roll out the pizza bases on slightly floured baking sheets (32cm diameter) spreading the base from the inside out. Season the pizzas with tomato sauce, to which you will have added salt, oregano and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>Bake one pizza at a time for about 5 minutes in the bottom rack of the oven selecting "fan" mode and setting the temperature to 280°C or at your oven's maximum power. Take it out, add the mozzarella and cook for about 3 or 4 more minutes, times may vary depending on the oven - if your oven doesn't reach 280°C it will take a few more minutes</li>
                    <li>Take the pizzas out of the oven, add the mayonnaise and sliced hard-boiled eggs, add some basil leaves or fresh oregano to taste</li>
                </ol>
