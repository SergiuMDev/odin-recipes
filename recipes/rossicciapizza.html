    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pizza Rossini is a typical specialty of the city of <strong>Pesaro</strong>. I became aware of this pizza thanks to my friend Lucia, who as a good Pesaro resident informed me of its existence and recommended it. This pizza is named after the famous Pesaro composer <strong>Gioachino Rossini</strong>, who used to request <strong><em>pizza margherita garnished with hard-boiled egg and mayonnaise</em></strong>. This is how the city of Pesaro introduced this specialty into its culinary tradition.
