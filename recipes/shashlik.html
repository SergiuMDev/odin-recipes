    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        Shashlik is a <strong>type of barbecue</strong> present in countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia, and even countries like Poland and Lithuania. The traditional Russian version is made only with lamb, salt, pepper, and onion. Today, <em>pork, beef, and fish</em> like sturgeon are also used, and the <strong>marinade</strong> will include lots of additional ingredients, such as vinegar, wine, pomegranate juice, kefir, and even mayonnaise, depending on the country and the recipe.

        The meat is traditionally threaded onto wide metal skewers and barbecued over charcoal. The meat does not need any big side dishes; fresh and ripe vegetables cut into chunks are usually best. Sometimes, jacket potatoes and different sauces accompany the meat.
