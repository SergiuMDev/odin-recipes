    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
            Shashlik is a <strong>type of barbecue</strong> present in countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia, and even countries like Poland and Lithuania. The traditional Russian version is made only with lamb, salt, pepper, and onion. Today, <em>pork, beef, and fish</em> like sturgeon are also used, and the <strong>marinade</strong> will include lots of additional ingredients, such as vinegar, wine, pomegranate juice, kefir, and even mayonnaise, depending on the country and the recipe.

            The meat is traditionally threaded onto wide metal skewers and barbecued over charcoal. The meat does not need any big side dishes; fresh and ripe vegetables cut into chunks are usually best. Sometimes, jacket potatoes and different sauces accompany the meat.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>lamb leg or loin, or pork neck - 2kg </li>
            <li>onion - 1kg</li>
            <li>salt - to taste</li>
            <li>ground black pepper - to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the meat into 5 cm cubes</li>
            <li>Peel the onions and cut them into rings. Place the onions in a large bowl, season with salt, and mix and mash them with your hands until they release juice and turn soft</li>
            <li>Place the meat into a large bowl (not a plastic one!), season with salt and pepper to taste, and mix so the meat gets well seasoned</li>
            <li>Add the onions and mix to combine them, then press on the mixture to remove all the air out of it. Marinate for 3-4 hours</li>
            <li>Remove all the onion from the meat and thread it onto wide, metal skewers</li>
            <li>Grill for about 20 minutes, turning often. During grilling, there should be no flames on the coal because it will burn the meat</li>
        </ol>
